  "description": "The DeleteTable operation deletes a table and all of its items. After a DeleteTable request, the specified table is in the DELETING state until DynamoDB completes the deletion. If the table is in the ACTIVE state, you can delete it. If a table is in CREATING or UPDATING states, then DynamoDB returns a ResourceInUseException. If the specified table does not exist, DynamoDB returns a ResourceNotFoundException. If table is already in the DELETING state, no error is returned."
